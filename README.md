# PendulumPlugin
This is a _**non-functional**_ version of a Juce-based VST3 plugin, implementing a double-pendulum system as a source of chaos. It should not be forked or contributed to in this state.

>Note: This project is highly subject to change, including being completely wiped and replaced with a new repository altogether.
