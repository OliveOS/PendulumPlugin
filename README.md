# PendulumPlugin
This is a _**partially non-functional**_ version of a Juce-based VST3 plugin, implementing a double-pendulum system as a source of chaos. It should not be forked or contributed to in this state.

The GUI components in red are for debugging purposes, and are tagged as such in the source code. They may be removed with no adverse effects.

>Note: This project is highly subject to change, including being completely wiped and replaced with a new repository altogether.
